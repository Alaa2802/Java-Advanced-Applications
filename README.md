# ☕ Java Advanced Applications Portfolio

A comprehensive collection of Java projects demonstrating mastery in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **GUI Development (JavaFX)**, **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, and **Database Integration**.

## 📂 Projects Overview

### 🎮 1. Hex Game Strategy (Game Development)
**Location:** `M5_Game_Development`
A fully functional strategy board game based on the classic **Hex** rules.
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamic Board Sizes (5x5 up to 20x20).
  - Advanced **Geometry Logic** using Polygon class for Hexagonal cells.
  - Implements the **"Swap Rule"** for fair play mechanics.
  - Pathfinding algorithms to detect win conditions (Network Connectivity).
- **Tech Stack:** JavaFX, Event Handling, OOP logic.

### 🚑 2. Emergency Service Simulation (Data Structures)
**Location:** `M4_DataStructures_Algorithms`
A simulation of a hospital emergency room queue system.
- **Concept:** Uses **Priority Queues** to manage patients based on triage levels (Critical vs. Normal) rather than arrival time.
- **Why it matters:** Demonstrates understanding of complex Data Structures and Real-world logic implementation.

### 🕸️ 3. Networking & Infrastructure Projects
**Location:** `M3_Network_Utils`
This module demonstrates a blend of network programming and network infrastructure design skills.

#### A. Java Web Crawler
- **Tech Stack:** Java, Regex, URL Handling.
- **Description:** A functional web bot designed to traverse the web. It connects to a starting URL, parses HTML content using **Regular Expressions**, and recursively discovers and lists sub-links within a defined scope.

#### B. Enterprise Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
- **Tech Stack:** Cisco Packet Tracer, VLANs, Router-on-a-Stick, DHCP.
- **Description:** Designed and configured a complete network topology for a multi-department office (HR, Finance, Engineering, Sales, IT).
- **Key Configurations:**
  - **VLAN Segmentation:** Created isolated VLANs (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) to separate departmental traffic and enhance security.
  - **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Implemented **Router-on-a-Stick** methodology using sub-interfaces (e.g., Gig0/0.10) to allow communication between VLANs.
  - **DHCP Services:** Configured dynamic **DHCP Pools** on the router to assign IP addresses automatically to PCs, while reserving static IPs for printers.
  - **Switching:** Managed Access and Trunk ports across multiple switches to ensure proper frame tagging (802.1Q).

### 🗄️ 4. Student Grade System (Database)
**Location:** `M2_Database_Projects`
A full CRUD application for managing student records.
- **Features:** Login system, Grade calculation, and Record storage.
- **Tech:** JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), SQL, MVC Architecture.

### 🎨 5. Interactive GUI Animations
**Location:** `M1_JavaFX_Projects`
A collection of visual applications showcasing UI capabilities.
- **Projects:**
  - **Clock Animation:** Real-time analog clock rendering.
